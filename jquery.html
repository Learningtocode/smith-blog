            <h1 class="Rabbit">My Jquery Page</h1> 
            <p class="Carrot">For this project, our class had to use jquery elements. We were suppose to add features of jquery to our project too, but I thought my website was already quite cramped with other features.  
                I also did not see anywhere to really use it. I thought this page could serve as an explanation page to all jquery's neat features. It may not be a great example of the use of Jquery but I will have to confess this confuse me a bit.  
                There was so much to be learned here, but I did not take the opening chance to preoccupied with this cross-platform. Even after I present this project to my classmates, I will still continue my studies in this client-side scripting of html. I will fix and change this page as the year goes on.</p>

            <p id='bird'>This section was quite confusing because my code was messy. I was confuse to what I was adding and removing. I might not have it down still, but it is a learning process. (At least, that's what people tell me.)</p> </div>

                <button id='ham'>Add A Paragraph!</button> 
                <p>Adding a paragraph just places additional text on the browser. It does not replace any text of any sort.</p>

            <div> 
                <p>Jquery uses animation as one of its features. It can make an image fade in or out. Images can come out of no where just with a click of a button. Examples of this are below.</p>
